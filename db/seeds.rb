# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Always use bang (!) operators on .create!() to force potential errors to print to the terminal
# When creating mutliple instances of a given model, you can use an array syntax:
#
# Game.create!([
#   {name: "Destiny", group_id: 3},
#   {name: "Betrayal at House on the Hill", group_id: 1},
#   {name: "Takenoko", group_id: 1},
#   {name: "Fluxx", group_id: 2}
# ])
